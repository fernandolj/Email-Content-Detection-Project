This paper’s focus was to use data reduction techniques to help find sensitive information in regards to terrorist activity. Data reduction is the idea of reducing the size of useful data, without losing the usefulness of the data itself. A simple example of this would be removing all comments from code 
to reduce the number of lines the code takes up without affecting what the actual code does. Terrorist data is similar to any other data activity that would be gathered for other purposes e.g: people communicating with each other via social media.
 The two algorithms the writers used for this task were: Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbor. The paper went over the general process in how Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbor work, and talk about how they used Apache Hadoop to compute clustering of the data. Same environments, nodes and data sizes were used to better compare the two algorithms to see which was best suited for this task, while they did not mention if one was more effective than the other in terms of accuracy, they did say that Neural Network scaled better in terms of computation time as the data grew in size compared to K-Nearest Neighbor.
Information Useful for us to Learn from:
The writers found that the Neural Network algorithm combined with Hadoop is effective for data reduction for large sums of data, we could apply this to our project by combining Pyspark with a Neural Network algorithm for data reduction to increase efficiency of the process overall.
